Sorting Visualizer 

This project demonstrates the working of various sorting algorithms through a visually interactive and educational interface. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the visualizer helps users understand sorting concepts in an intuitive way.

Features
Visualization of popular sorting algorithms:
Bubble Sort
Heap Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
User-friendly interface with dynamic animations.
Adjustable speed and array size for personalized learning.
Easy-to-use controls for starting, pausing, and resetting the visualization.
Sorting Algorithms Included
1. Bubble Sort
A simple comparison-based algorithm.
Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Time Complexity: O(n²).
2. Heap Sort
A comparison-based algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure.
Efficient for large datasets.
Time Complexity: O(n log n).
3. Merge Sort
A divide-and-conquer algorithm.
Recursively divides the array into halves, sorts, and then merges them.
Time Complexity: O(n log n).
4. Quick Sort
Another divide-and-conquer algorithm.
Selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array around the pivot.
Time Complexity: O(n log n) on average.
5. Insertion Sort
Builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
Suitable for small or nearly sorted datasets.
Time Complexity: O(n²).
6. Selection Sort
Divides the array into sorted and unsorted sections.
Repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted section and places it in the sorted section.
Time Complexity: O(n²).
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the visualizer.
CSS: Styling and layout.
JavaScript: Logic and animations.
How to Use
